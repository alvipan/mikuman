Mikuman (Mikrotik User Manager) is an application inspired by its predecessor Mikhmon. It is a web-based application to manage Mikrotik users, both Hotspot and PPoE.

Mikuman is still under development and we accept the community to build it together and do testing, debugging, fixing, updating, etc.

Built on the laravel framework combined with tailwind css makes Mikuman a more modern application than its predecessor.
