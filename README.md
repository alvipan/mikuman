### Instalation
Mikuman can run on any web server, but for security reasons we recommend that you only run it on your local server.

The easy way to run Mikuman on your computer is to simply download <b>mikuman-vX.X-webserver.zip</b> and extract it. We still include Mikhmon's webserver in it. Run MikhmonWebserver.exe and start the server.

If you want to run Mikuman without MikhmonWebserver. You can download mikuman-vX.X.zip and install it on your server. In order for Mikuman to run properly, make sure the document root is pointed to the public folder.
